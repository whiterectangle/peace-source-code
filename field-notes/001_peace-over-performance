# Field Note 001: Peace > Performance

Performance is rewarded.  
Algorithms feed on outrage.  
And the world burns while the stage lights flicker.

But peace doesn’t need applause.

It doesn’t monetize your attention.  
It doesn’t ask for likes.  
It waits.

Presence is not reactive.  
It’s resistant.

A refusal to become what broke you.  
A decision to stay human—especially when the world forgets how.

You don’t have to perform to matter.  
You don’t have to win to be free.

You just have to choose peace.  
And mean it.

**White Rectangle.**
