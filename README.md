# Peace is Open Source

This is not software.

It’s a framework for those choosing presence over performance, clarity over chaos, and peace without permission.

You don’t need to clone this repo to understand it.  
You just have to **mean it**.

## Core Principles

- Presence > Performance  
- Stillness > Spectacle  
- Refusal > Rage  
- Clarity > Noise  
- Care > Control  
- Peace > Power

## How to Use This

1. **Carry the symbol**  
   The White Rectangle is a signal. A refusal. A beginning.

2. **Live by the code**  
   This isn’t about perfection. It’s about alignment.

3. **Fork the spirit, not the syntax**  
   Adapt it. Share it. Make it yours—but keep it clear.

## Why GitHub?

Because code isn’t just for machines.  
Because frameworks shape behavior.  
Because peace deserves better documentation.
