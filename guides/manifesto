# White Rectangle Manifesto

This is not a movement.  
It’s a refusal.

A quiet signal in a world that rewards noise.  
A boundary drawn without violence.  
A flag without allegiance.  
A presence without performance.

We do not seek power.  
We withdraw from its game.

We do not shout.  
We make space.

We do not follow.  
We choose.

---

We believe:

- Peace is not passive.  
- Stillness is not surrender.  
- Presence is a form of protest.  
- Technology can serve truth, not control.  
- Symbols can remind us of what words forget.  
- Everyone deserves a way out of systems built on domination.

---

We offer this symbol freely.  
No trademarks. No gatekeeping. No agenda.

**Use it with care.  
Carry it with meaning.  
Share it without distortion.**

This is not a brand.  
It’s a seed.

**White Rectangle.**
