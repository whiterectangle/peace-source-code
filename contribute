# How to Contribute

This isn’t a project in the traditional sense.

There are no pull requests.  
No forks to merge.  
No updates to review.

Because the code isn’t in the files.  
It’s in the **way you live**.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Live with presence.  
- Practice peace—especially when it’s inconvenient.  
- Reject domination in all its forms.  
- Use the symbol with clarity, not for clout.  
- Hold space where others are silenced.  
- Don’t sell it. Don’t distort it. Don’t co-opt it.

If you want to contribute, you already are.

## Attribution

There isn’t any.  
No names. No signatures.  
Just intention.

Use what’s here.  
Build what’s needed.  
Keep it clean.
